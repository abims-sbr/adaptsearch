 ------ Occurences and frequencies of codons, amino-acids, amino-acids types -------

The script counts the number of codons, amino acids, and types of amino acids in sequences,
as well as the mutation bias from one item to another between 2 sequences.

Counting are then compared to empirical p-values, obtained from bootstrapped sequences obtained from a subset of sequences.
In the output files, the pvalues indicate the position of the observed data in a distribution of empirical countings obtained from
a resample of the data. Values above 0.95 indicate a significantly higher counting, values under 0.05 a significantly lower counting.
    Sequences file : concatenation.fasta
    Species retained for countings : Ps,Pp,Pu,Ac,Ap,Pf,Pg,Ph,Pi

Processing : reading input file, opening output files, building dictionaries.
    Warning : countings might be biased and show high differences between species because of high variations of the indels proportions among sequences.
    Frequences are more representative.
